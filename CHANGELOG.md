Updating your Beamer theme repository on GitHub is a great way to keep it current and useful for users. Here are some best practices for updating your file:

1. Prepare Your Local Environment
Clone your repository locally if you haven't already:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ambropo/JambroBeamerTheme.git
cd JambroBeamerTheme
Ensure your local repository is up to date:
bash
Copy code
git pull origin main
(Replace main with your branch name if different.)
2. Create a New Branch for Updates
Use feature branches for changes to keep your main branch stable:
bash
Copy code
git checkout -b update-theme-files
3. Make Changes
Modify the necessary files or add new ones in your local repository.
Follow semantic versioning to tag updates (e.g., v1.1.0 for minor updates, v2.0.0 for major ones).
4. Test Locally
Build your Beamer theme locally to ensure the updates don't break functionality.
Test sample presentations using the updated theme.
5. Commit Your Changes
Add a descriptive commit message:
bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Updated Beamer theme: fixed color scheme and added new title page style"
6. Push Changes to GitHub
Push the changes to your branch:
bash
Copy code
git push origin update-theme-files
7. Open a Pull Request (PR)
Go to your repository on GitHub.
Open a pull request from your update-theme-files branch into main.
Write a clear PR description, explaining the changes and their purpose.
8. Request Feedback or Review
If your repository is collaborative, tag collaborators for review.
Consider enabling "Discussions" or "Issues" in your repo for community feedback.
9. Merge and Tag Release
Once reviewed and approved, merge your PR into the main branch.
Tag the new version:
bash
Copy code
git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Release version 1.1.0: added features and bug fixes"
git push origin v1.1.0
10. Update Documentation
Ensure README.md reflects the updates (e.g., new features, installation instructions).
Add a CHANGELOG.md to track updates.
11. Announce the Update
Use the GitHub Releases feature to create a release with notes:
Go to the "Releases" tab in your repository.
Click Draft a new release, select the tag, and write release notes.
Optionally, share updates on social media or relevant forums to inform users.
By following these practices, you’ll maintain a clean, user-friendly repository while encouraging contributions and user engagement.
